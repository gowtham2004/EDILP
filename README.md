An Intelligent Assistant for Lonley_Programmer

hello soldiers!

    Iam creating a new type of automation system by using python to ease the work of doing bing searches.
		Now we are entering a AI world with great one of the most useful part in AI is Automation though Automation is not a part of AI but it's like AI , an automation can bring you a cup of coffee huh! jokes apart.
    This is my first AI application made of python so i need to cover most of the utility based tools in python.
		I know python is a easy to learn and simple to code language hence I used python with some other packages to improve the work flow.
    
		NOTE: This will be only for education purposes if anybody copy this he/she should be face the leagal issues the usage subjected to terms and conditions.
